# The 4 Game-Theoretic Models

Behind 50+ collapses there are only **four** recurring game structures. Classify
any new design into one (or more) of these, then read off the failure mode and
the critical condition. Runnable, calibrated versions live in `simulations/`.

---

## Model 1 — Bank Run (Diamond–Dybvig) → *sudden* collapse
**Where**: any platform promising instant, full, **first-come-first-served**
redemption against illiquid / maturity-mismatched assets (CeFi lenders,
exchanges, withdrawable yield protocols).

**Game**: the redemption game has **two pure-strategy Nash equilibria**:

| Equilibrium | Everyone | Outcome | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Good | waits | protocol fine, all repaid | fragile (belief-held) |
| Bad | runs | assets fire-sold, latecomers ~0 | self-locking |

**Best response**: if you *believe* others will run, your dominant strategy is to
run **first** (positive first-mover advantage). So the bad equilibrium is
self-fulfilling — it needs no real deterioration, only a belief jump (a *sunspot*:
a leaked balance sheet, a tweet, a small de-peg).

**Critical condition**: liquidity coverage `L` < instantly-redeemable liabilities.
Below that, even zero initial panic tips into a run (see `sim4`).
**Antidote**: pro-rata haircuts (no FCFS) → removes first-mover advantage → run
basin collapses. Instances: FTX, Celsius, Voyager.

## Model 2 — (3,3) Coordination → *unravels to backing*
**Where**: bonding/treasury/rebase staking ("(3,3)") with very high APY.

**Game**: the marketed "(3,3): stake-stake is best" hides where payouts come from
(inflation + new bond capital). The real game is a prisoner's dilemma:

```
                 other STAKE         other SELL
 I STAKE     (nominal+, real depends   (I'm diluted,
              on new money)             they cash out)   ← I lose
 I SELL      (I cash out)              (stampede, premium→backing)
```

Your nominal balance grows with APY, but your **real share = your tokens / total
supply** is diluted. Staking only pays while **new-money inflow ≥ dilution**.
Backward induction: a "last buyer" exists → unravels from the end.

**Critical condition**: sustained new-money growth < dilution rate ⇒ premium
(`price / backing`) collapses to 1×. Note: it falls to **backing, not zero** (the
treasury floors it) — the key difference from algo-stables (see `sim2`).
**Antidote**: pay from real revenue; symmetrize exit; publish backing. Instances:
OHM and all forks.

## Model 3 — Seigniorage Absorbing Barrier → *to zero*
**Where**: dual-token mint/burn algorithmic stablecoins.

**Game/arbitrage**:
```
stable < $1:  burn 1 stable → mint $1 of reserve token (sell)   → contracts stable supply
stable > $1:  burn $1 reserve token → mint 1 stable             → expands stable supply
```
The peg holds in a bull market but the **downward** arc converts stable-coin
selling into reserve-token *minting + dumping*.

**Critical condition** — solvency ratio `R = M_reserve / S_stable`:
- Looks safe at `R ≫ 1` (Terra peaked ≈ 2.2).
- But `M_reserve` is **reflexive**: redemptions mint+dump it → price ↓ → `M ↓` →
  `R ↓` → more panic. This is `λ > 1`.
- `R < 1` is an **absorbing barrier**: past it, full redemption *cannot* happen
  without driving the reserve token to 0. Terra crossed it in ~72h (see `sim1`).

**Antidote**: reserve-ratio circuit breaker + partial collateral. Rate-limiting
mint only delays the run. The real fix: drop "algorithmic + own token". Instances:
Terra, Iron, Basis, ESD.

## Model 4 — Unlock / Inflation Supply Glut → *slow bleed*
**Where**: low-float / high-FDV launches; uncapped reward emissions.

**Game**: a multi-period game with **cost-basis asymmetry**:
```
marginal seller = insiders (VC/team), cost basis ≈ 0  → reservation price ≈ 0
marginal buyer  = retail, cost basis = market price   → needs narrative to bid
```
Every unlock injects ~zero-cost-basis supply. Add **information asymmetry**
(insiders know the real unlock calendar / treasury / retention; retail sees only
the chart) → an Akerlof lemon market. No sunspot, no coordination failure — just a
supply curve marching right on schedule.

**Critical condition**: `unlocks (next 12mo) / circulating` and `FDV / real
revenue` too high; `sink/faucet < 1` for reward emissions (see `sim3`).
**Antidote**: linear long unlocks (no cliffs), float matched to demand, milestone-
gated insider unlocks, public on-chain calendar. Instances: ICP, FIL, WLD, APE;
Axie/STEPN for the emission variant.

| pays high APY from inflation/new bonds | 2 (3,3) | to backing | new-money growth |
| is a self-collateralized algo-stablecoin | 3 Absorbing barrier | to zero | reserve ratio R |
| has low float / uncapped emission | 4 Supply glut | slow bleed | unlock calendar |
