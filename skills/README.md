# Skill Pack — Tokenomics Soundcheck

An open-source skill distilled from forensic analysis of 50+ landmark token
collapses and **calibrated against a control group of survivors**. It helps you
**audit a token economic design for death-spiral risk** and **design resilient
tokenomics**.

## Installing it in your agent
The skill follows the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard and
is fully **self-contained** — it works in Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor,
Gemini CLI, Copilot, Grok Build, and any other spec-compatible agent. Install
via the Claude Code plugin marketplace
(`/plugin marketplace add wusijian007/tokenomics-soundcheck`) or by copying
`tokenomics-soundcheck/` into your agent's skills directory
(`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.grok/skills/`, …) — all options in the repo's
[INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md). It triggers when you ask about token model design,
sustainability, stablecoin/staking/GameFi/points/restaking mechanics, unlock
schedules, or due diligence on a token.

## Using it as a human reference
- **Evaluating a project**: `SKILL.md` → quick screen in `audit-protocol.md` →
  full audit: `game-models.md` (classify) → `scorecard.md` (spiral score) →
  `economic-security.md` (security panel) → `../simulations/` (stress-test) →
  valuation module → report template with blind-spot register.
- **Designing a token**: `design-playbook.md` process + `archetype-playbooks.md`
  for your vertical → build from `design-patterns.md` (16 positive mechanisms),
  with the `liquidity-engineering.md` / `circular-economy.md` / `incentive-audit.md`
  deep dives; constrained by `anti-patterns.md` (15 axioms), evidenced by
  `survivors.md`.
- **Running it as a tool**: `../tools/` — `stress_runner.py` scores a design
  spec into the step-9 verdict; `report_generator.py` formats a completed audit.

The deep analysis with full derivations is in the repo root:
`death-spiral-deep-analysis.md` (Chinese: `代币经济学死亡螺旋_深度分析与失败Skills.md`).
