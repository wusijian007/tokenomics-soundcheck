# Validation Layer — Out-of-Sample Testing of the Scorecard

The calibration in `data/scorecard_calibration.py` is **in-sample**: it re-scores
the same cases the anti-patterns were distilled from. This layer tests the
instrument on evidence it has never seen, in two tiers of increasing rigor:

| Tier | What | File | Bias remaining |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Holdout backtest** — 15 historical cases never used in derivation, calibration, or any repo document | [`holdout_backtest.py`](holdout_backtest.py) | hindsight-scoring bias (mitigated, not eliminated) |
| 2 | **Prospective registry** — living projects scored and frozen *before* outcomes exist, with falsifiable predictions and fixed review dates | [`prospective-registry.md`](prospective-registry.md) | none (the gold standard; requires time) |

---

## Outcome definitions (pre-registered, used by both tiers)

- **`spiral_collapse`** — an engine realized: permanent peg loss, reward-token
  hyperinflation, or a forced mint/dump/liquidation unwind; the token or claim
  ends ≤ −95% vs its mechanism baseline with no recovery ≥ 12 months.
- **`structural_bleed`** — ≥ −90% from cycle peak, sustained ≥ 6 months, driven
  by supply mechanics (unlocks, emissions, airdrop cliffs); the protocol may
  keep operating.
- **`survived_stress`** — a documented stress episode (run, de-peg, cascade,
  or ≥50% market-wide drawdown) with the mechanism intact afterward: peg
  restored within 30 days, redemptions honored, or the economy still
  functioning.
- Baselines: pegged assets are measured against the peg; others against both
  cycle ATH and TGE price (report both).

**What the instrument predicts** (from `scorecard.md` / `anti-patterns.md`):

1. Any **engine row at 2** → `spiral_collapse` risk class.
2. **Structure row(s) at 2, no engine** → shape is `structural_bleed` or
   violent deleveraging; final outcome decided by the **zero-price anchor
   test** (weak anchor → bleed; hard anchor → recoverable stress).
3. **No rows at 2** → no structural failure; market risk only.

The *weighted total* is an intensity gauge, not the classifier. A validation
run grades the **rule (1)–(3)**, and reports the totals for context.

## Tier 1 — Holdout backtest

### Leakage audit

Requirement: a holdout case must appear **nowhere** in this repository — not in
the case library (L1), the mechanism analysis (L2), the skill pack (L3), the
calibration set, or the survivors control group. Verified by full-repo text
search on 2026-07-02 (all 15 names below: zero matches before this layer was
added).

Selection also aims at **temporal holdout** where possible: Blur and Celestia's
declines realized in 2024–25, after the S1–S10 patterns were fixed from the
2009–2022 canon.

### Cases (8 collapses, 7 stress survivors)

Collapses: Neutrino USDN, Deus DEI, Tomb Finance, StrongBlock, Titano,
Solidly, Blur, Celestia.
Survivors: Tether USDT (post-FTX run), Frax (Terra contagion), Chainlink,
Rocket Pool rETH (June 2022 LST stress), Aave (2022 cascade), Ampleforth
(2020–21 rebase cycles), Pendle (2024 LRT points unwind).

Scoring rules: each row scored with the `scorecard.md` measurement procedure
using only information publicly available at the `score_asof` date (before the
outcome); per-case justifications live in the script/CSV so any scoring call
can be audited and challenged.

### Honesty — what Tier 1 can and cannot claim

It eliminates **derivation leakage** (the tool never saw these cases). It
cannot fully eliminate **hindsight bias**: the scorer knows the outcomes.
Mitigations: mechanical row procedures, pre-outcome information vintage,
published per-row justifications. The residual bias is exactly why Tier 2
exists.

### Result (run `python holdout_backtest.py`)

- Collapses total **12–25** (median 16); survivors **3–10** (median 5).
- **The total alone is a weak classifier out-of-sample**: 6 of 8 collapses and
  1 survivor (Frax, 10) land together in the 8–18 "elevated" band.
- **The engine → structure → anchor rule classifies 15/15 correctly**:
  - 6 collapses with an engine at 2 → `spiral_collapse` ✓ (USDN, DEI, TOMB,
    STRONG, TITANO, SOLID)
  - 2 collapses with structure-only flags + weak anchor → `structural_bleed` ✓
    (BLUR, TIA — mirroring ICP in-sample)
  - 7 survivors with no row at 2 → `survived_stress` ✓ (Frax at 10 points but
    all partials — the same "stressed survivor" geometry as CRV in-sample)
- Chart: `simulations/charts/data_holdout_separation.png`.

This is the instrument's strongest evidence to date: the *decision rule*
(not the raw score) generalizes to cases it never saw, and its known weak spot
(the elevated band) fails in the same, predicted way as in-sample.

## Tier 2 — Prospective registry

[`prospective-registry.md`](prospective-registry.md) freezes, as of
**2026-07-02**: scores, flags, band, and **falsifiable predictions** for living
projects, plus instrument-level success criteria. Review dates: 2027-07-02 and
2028-07-02.

Integrity rules:

1. **Append-only.** After the freeze, the registry is never edited — only
   dated entries in its Amendment Log (e.g., a materially wrong input, or a
   flag change from new unlock data).
2. **Timestamping.** Commit the frozen files to git and push; the commit hash
   + hosting timestamp are the proof of priority. Optionally anchor the file
   hash with OpenTimestamps (`ots stamp prospective-registry.md`).
3. **Grading.** At each review date, grade every prediction
   TRUE / FALSE / UNRESOLVED with evidence links, appended to the log.
   The confusion table grades the *instrument*; per criterion C4, two or more
   misclassifications at the 24-month review force a documented revision of
   the scorecard.
4. **No cherry-picking.** Projects cannot be silently dropped; a delisted or
   migrated token is graded against the outcome definitions as-is.

## Freeze record

SHA-256 of the artifacts frozen on **2026-07-02** (the git commit introducing
them is the authoritative timestamp; regenerating `holdout_backtest.csv` from
the unmodified script reproduces its hash):
